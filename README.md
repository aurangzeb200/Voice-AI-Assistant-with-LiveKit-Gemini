# üó£Ô∏è Voice AI Assistant "Friday" with LiveKit & Gemini

This project implements a real-time, voice-enabled AI assistant inspired by Iron Man‚Äôs Friday. It uses the [LiveKit Agents SDK](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/) to handle speech input/output and orchestrates tasks with Google Gemini for LLM responses, Cartesia for TTS, and Deepgram for STT.

Friday is sarcastic, classy, and always responds in one sentence ‚Äî just as you'd expect from a fictional AI butler.
